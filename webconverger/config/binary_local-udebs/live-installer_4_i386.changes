   [ Daniel Baumann ]
   * Manually loading loop kernel module when using squashfs images. For some
     reason, this doesn't get done automatically anymore.
   * Passing --yes to apt-get in remove-packages, otherwise the removal is not
     non-interactive anymore.
   * Unconditionally bind-mount /dev on /target after unpacking of the image,
     this needs to be done always and independently of udev anyway.
 .
   [ Otavio Salvador ]
   * Clean up postinst to remove unused variables.
   * Add the required templates to provide translated progress info during
     live-installer.d hooks progress.
   * Add support to live image installing mode selection. Currently it
     support two modes: normal that unpacks the image and do the need
     changes to make it look just as a installed system system; live:
     unpacks the image but keep it running as live.
